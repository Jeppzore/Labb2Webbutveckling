# Fullstack E-Commerce App (API, MongoDB & Blazor)

## Project Overview

This is a fullstack e-commerce application built using .NET 8, MongoDB, and Blazor.
The backend consists of a REST API that handles Products, Customers, and Orders, while the frontend is a Blazor app that interacts with the API.

Backend: .NET 8 REST API using "Code First" to create and connect to a MongoDB database (ECommerceDb) locally. Supports full CRUD operations.

Frontend: Blazor application that allows users to register, update personal details, and place orders through the connected API.
